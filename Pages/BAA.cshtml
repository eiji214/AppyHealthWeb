            3. Termination Upon Breach of Provisions. Notwithstanding any other
            provision of this Agreement, Covered Entity may immediately terminate this
            Agreement if it determines that Business Associate breaches any term in
            this Agreement. Alternatively, Covered Entity may give written notice to
            Business Associate in the event of a breach and give Business Associate
            five (5) business days to cure such breach. Covered Entity shall also have
            the option to immediately stop all further disclosures of PHI to Business
            Associate if Covered Entity reasonably determines that Business Associate
            has breached its obligations under this Agreement. In the event that
            termination of this Agreement and the Agreement is not feasible, Business
            Associate hereby acknowledges that the Covered Entity shall be required to
            report the breach to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
            Human Services, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
            Agreement to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Return or Destruction of Protected Health Information upon Termination.
            Upon the termination of this Agreement, unless otherwise directed by
            Covered Entity, Business Associate shall either return or destroy all PHI
            received from the Covered Entity or created or received by Business
            Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity in which Business Associate
            maintains in any form. Business Associate shall not retain any copies of
            such PHI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Business
            Associate determines that returning or destroying the Protected Health
            Information is infeasible upon termination of this Agreement, Business
            Associate shall provide to Covered Entity notification of the condition
            that makes return or destruction infeasible. To the extent that it is not
            feasible for Business Associate to return or destroy such PHI, the terms
            and provisions of this Agreement shall survive such termination or
            expiration and such PHI shall be used or disclosed solely as permitted by
            law for so long as Business Associate maintains such Protected Health
            Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties agree that the terms of this
            Agreement shall apply only to themselves and are not for the benefit of any
            third party beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. De-Identified Data. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement,
            Business Associate and its subcontractors may disclose non-personally
            identifiable information provided that the disclosed information does not
            include a key or other mechanism that would enable the information to be
            identified.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. Amendment. Business Associate and Covered Entity agree to amend this
            Agreement to the extent necessary to allow either party to comply with the
            Privacy Standards, the Standards for Electronic Transactions, the Security
            Standards, or other relevant state or federal laws or regulations created
            or amended to protect the privacy of patient information. All such
            amendments shall be made in a writing signed by both parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. Interpretation. Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be resolved in
            favor of a meaning that permits Covered Entity to comply with the then most
            current version of HIPAA and the HIPAA privacy regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            9. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
            meanings assigned to them as outlined in HIPAA and its related regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. Survival. The obligations imposed by this Agreement shall survive any
            expiration or termination of this Agreement.
