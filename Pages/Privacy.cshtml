            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Appy Health Inc. website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
            online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk
            by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
            viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
            only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
            to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that
            you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Appy
            Health Inc. pages, or register with Appy Health Inc. site or services, a
            cookie helps Appy Health Inc. to recall your specific information on
            subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
            information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When
            you return to the same Appy Health Inc. website, the information you
            previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Appy Health
            Inc. features that you customized.

        <p>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
            setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies,
            you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
            Appy Health Inc. services or websites you visit.
